Welcome to Subspace, your go-to news app that keeps you updated with the latest news from around the world. Subspace not only fetches news from various sources but also allows you to save your favorite articles for offline reading. Our app is designed with a minimalistic bi-color dark UI that enhances your reading experience, and it features a glowing favorite icon to make saving articles a breeze.
Features
API Integration

Subspace integrates seamlessly with a RESTful API to fetch the latest news articles
Blog List View

Subspace provides a clean and organized list view of news articles. Each article is presented with its title and an associated image.
Detailed Article View

Tapping on a news article in the list view takes you to a detailed view of the article. Here, you can read the full details of the selected article, including its title and image.
Navigation

Subspace has an intuitive navigation system that allows you to seamlessly switch between the list view and the detailed article view.
Interactive Features

We've made Subspace interactive with the following features:

    Favorite Articles: You can mark articles as favorites with a single tap. Simply click the glowing star icon, and the article will be saved to your favorites.

State Management

Subspace utilizes Flutter's state management solutions to efficiently manage the app's state, ensuring a smooth user experience.
Error Handling

We've implemented robust error handling in Subspace. If the API is unavailable or returns an error, the app gracefully displays a friendly error message to keep you informed.
UI/UX Design

Our design philosophy centers around a minimalist bi-color dark UI, enhancing your reading experience while reducing eye strain during nighttime reading. The glowing favorite icon adds an elegant touch to the app, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.
Offline Mode (Bonus Feature)

As a bonus feature, Subspace supports offline reading. We've implemented this functionality using Flutter's local storage (SharedPreferences). Now you can access and interact with your favorite articles even when you're not connected to the internet.
